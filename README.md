## 🚀 Project Title

**SentinelAI – AI vs AI System for Detecting Advanced Convenience Phishing Attacks**



## 💡 Idea

With the rise of generative AI, phishing attacks have evolved into highly personalized and convincing “convenience emails” such as fake delivery notifications, payment alerts, and account warnings. These emails are carefully crafted to exploit human psychology and often bypass traditional spam filters. SentinelAI aims to counter this threat by using artificial intelligence to analyze email content, embedded URLs, and visual elements to detect sophisticated phishing campaigns generated using AI.



## ❓ Problem Statement

Modern phishing attacks leverage AI to create realistic, context-aware emails that manipulate user trust and urgency. These attacks exploit psychological triggers such as fear, convenience, and authority, making them difficult for both users and traditional rule-based spam filters to detect. There is a growing need for an intelligent detection system that can identify these AI-generated phishing emails by analyzing linguistic patterns, visual spoofing, and malicious URL structures, and provide a clear risk assessment to users.


## 🧠 Definition & Background

Phishing has transitioned from generic scam emails to highly targeted, AI-generated messages that mimic trusted brands and services. These “convenience phishing” emails often include:

* Spoofed logos and branding
* Lookalike domains and shortened URLs
* Emotionally manipulative language
* Context-aware personalization

This project follows the **AI vs AI in Cybersecurity** theme by using defensive AI techniques to detect and mitigate offensive AI-driven phishing campaigns.



## ✅ Proposed Solution

SentinelAI is an AI-powered phishing detection system that analyzes emails and messages to identify advanced phishing attempts. The system uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to detect psychological manipulation tactics, **Computer Vision** to identify logo spoofing and visual impersonation, and **URL analysis** to flag suspicious and lookalike domains. Each email or message is assigned a **risk score**, helping users quickly understand the threat level and take appropriate action.



## 🔄 System Workflow

1. User uploads or inputs email/message content into the system
2. NLP module analyzes text for manipulation patterns and phishing intent
3. URL analysis module checks embedded links for malicious or lookalike domains
4. Computer vision module inspects logos and images for brand spoofing
5. AI model aggregates results and generates a phishing risk score
6. System displays classification: **Safe**, **Suspicious**, or **Phishing**
