#  HK-17 – AI-Based Detection of Sophisticated Phishing Campaigns

##  Project Title

**SentinelAI – AI vs AI System for Detecting Advanced Convenience Phishing Attacks**


##  Idea

With the rise of generative AI, phishing attacks have evolved into highly personalized and convincing “convenience emails” such as fake delivery notifications, payment alerts, and account warnings. These emails are carefully crafted to exploit human psychology and often bypass traditional spam filters. SentinelAI aims to counter this threat by using artificial intelligence to analyze email content, embedded URLs, and visual elements to detect sophisticated phishing campaigns generated using AI.

##  Problem Statement

HK-17 – AI-Based Detection of Sophisticated Phishing Campaigns

## Proposed Solution

1. AI-powered phishing detection platform focused on advanced and evasive attacks

2. Leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify psychological manipulation tactics (urgency, fear, authority abuse)

3. Uses Computer Vision to detect logo spoofing and visual brand impersonation

4. Performs URL and domain analysis to flag suspicious, shortened, and lookalike domains

5. Assigns a comprehensive risk score to every email or message

6. Enables users to instantly assess threat severity and take decisive action

7. Designed to reduce false negatives and improve real-world phishing resilience

##  System Workflow

1. User uploads or inputs email/message content into the system

2. NLP module analyzes text for manipulation patterns and phishing intent

3. URL analysis module checks embedded links for malicious or lookalike domains

4. Computer vision module inspects logos and images for brand spoofing
 
5. AI model aggregates results and generates a phishing risk score
 
6. System displays classification: **Safe**, **Suspicious**, or **Phishing**

##  Key Features

1. Detection of AI-generated phishing emails
    
2. NLP-based analysis of psychological manipulation techniques
   
3. URL reputation and lookalike domain detection
    
4. Logo spoofing detection using computer vision
    
5. Risk score-based email classification
 
6. Web-based interface for easy access and analysis

## **Technology Stack Architecture**

**Frontend**

**React & TypeScript**: Built as a modern Single Page Application (SPA). TypeScript ensures "Type Safety," preventing memory leaks and crashes that could be exploited.

**Tailwind CSS**: Used for a "Cyber-Core" design language. It leverages hardware-accelerated CSS for the 3D grid animations and "Laser-Beam" scanning effects without lagging the browser.

**Recharts**: A composable charting library used to visualize "Live Threat Telemetry," converting raw AI detection data into readable patterns.

**Client-Side Processing**: The app uses html2canvas and jsPDF to generate forensic reports locally on your machine, ensuring the data analyzed doesn't stay on a server longer than necessary.

**Backend**

**AI-as-a-Service (Gemini API)**: Instead of a traditional monolithic database/server, this app uses an Edge Intelligence model. It communicates directly with Google's high-speed global inference servers.

**Environment Injection**: Sensitive credentials (like the API Key) are managed via Vite's environment variables (process.env), ensuring they are never hard-coded into the source logic.

## The Role of Artificial Intelligence (The "Brain")

SentinelAI does not use simple "If/Then" rules. Traditional security looks for "Bad Words"; our AI looks for Bad Intent.

**Multimodal Reasoning**: The system uses gemini-3-flash-preview for logic and gemini-2.5-flash-image for vision. It can "see" a screenshot of a fake login page and identify that the logo is slightly blurry or the font is off—markers of a phishing attempt.

**Cognitive NLP Analysis**: It analyzes "Psychological Triggers." It detects if a message is using Artificial Urgency (e.g., "You have 10 minutes to act") or Authority Impersonation (mimicking a CEO’s writing style).

**Static Code Analysis**: When scanning API keys or files, the AI performs "Entropy Checks." It calculates how random a string is to determine if it’s a high-value secret (like a Stripe or AWS key) versus just a random string of text.

 ## Output 
The system produces a Forensic Intelligence Report, which includes:

**Risk Score (0-100)**: A mathematical confidence level of the threat.

**Risk Classification**: Categorization into SAFE, SUSPICIOUS, or MALICIOUS.

**Threat Vectors**: A breakdown of why it flagged the content (NLP triggers, URL redirects, or visual anomalies).

**Actionable Remediation**: Technical steps to take (e.g., "Rotate your AWS key immediately," "Block sender domain").

**Exportable Evidence**: Reports in PDF, Word, and PPT formats for corporate security audits.

##  Conclusion

SentinelAI demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used defensively to combat increasingly sophisticated AI-driven phishing campaigns. By analyzing text, visuals, and URLs together, the system provides a comprehensive and scalable solution to detect phishing attacks that exploit convenience and trust, aligning perfectly with the AI vs AI cybersecurity paradigm.
